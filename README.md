## 📝 Project Overview

This repository offers 20+ Python notebooks (`.ipynb`) designed to teach and demonstrate standard NLP techniques with real-world examples. From tokenizing raw text to extracting topic distributions and measuring semantic similarity, this repo helps practitioners and learners build practical NLP pipelines.

Modules cover everything from preprocessing to feature engineering and basic text classification workflows using industry-standard libraries like NLTK and spaCy.

## 🚀 Structure & Technique Modules

- **Tokenization & Tokenization Variants** – whitespace, regex, custom splits  
- **Stop-words Removal** – classic English stop-words, NIL/JUNK filtering  
- **Stemming & Lemmatization** – rule-based over Snowball and WordNet  
- **Tweet Cleaning & Tokenization** – handling URLs, user mentions, hashtags  
- **Entity & Noun Extraction** – extracting usernames, nouns via POS tagging  
- **Text Representation**  
  - TF-IDF matrix generation  
  - Custom word-embedding exploration  
  - Word Mover’s Distance similarity computations (NLTK & spaCy)  
- **Topic Modeling** – Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic extraction  
- **Text Classification** – SMS spam detection using classic ML pipelines
